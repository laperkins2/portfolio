              Growing up as a kid, without a care in the world. I could not have
              imagine how my life up to this point would have played out. You
              have dreams of what you want to accomplish and become. From six to
              ten I can remember I wanted to be an architect, electronic
              engineer and superman. Now from 11 to 16, i still had those dreams
              but this was the time where other influnces started playing tug of
              war with me. I started trying to figure out who I was. Sixteen to
              twenty-one was a rough period, I must say. Can you remember
              telling your mom, I can't wait to I get big and move out. We can
              laugh at that now. But going through what I went through lead me
              to a 20 year career as a Registered Respiratoy therapist, helping
              others. As I continue on that journey I'm
              <em><strong>forking</strong></em> (do you <strong>git</strong> it)
              off that path as a FullStack Developer student currently at Codex
              Academy.
