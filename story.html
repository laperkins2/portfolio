              Growing up as a kid, without a care in the world. I could not have
              imagine how my life up to this point would have played out. You
              have dreams of what you want to accomplish and become. From six to
              ten I can remember I wanted to be an architect, electronic
              engineer and superman. Now from 11 to 16, i still had those dreams
              but this was the time where other influnces started playing tug of
              war with me. I started trying to figure out who I was. Sixteen to
              twenty-one was a rough period, I must say. Can you remember
              telling your mom, I can't wait to I get big and move out. We can
              laugh at that now. But going through what I went through lead me
              to a 20 year career as a Registered Respiratoy therapist, helping
              others. As I continue on that journey I'm
              <em><strong>forking</strong></em> (do you <strong>git</strong> it)
              of that path as a FullStack Developer student currently at Codex
              Academy.

              I love watching sports and spending time with my family. I try to
              provide them with much love as I can and explain to them life
              situations. They are going to go through the same process as me,
              and I'll be there for them no matter what as my mom was there for
              me. On a more positive note, how bout them Steelers and my top
              three food dishes.
