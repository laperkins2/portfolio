            Growing up as a kid, without a care in the world. I could not have
            imagine how my life up to this point would have played out. You have
            dreams of what you want to accomplish and become. From six to ten I
            can remember I wanted to be an architect, electronic engineer and
            superman. Now from 11 to 16, i still had those dreams but this was
            the time where other influnces started playing tug of war with me. I
            started trying to figure out who I was. Sixteen to twenty-one was a
            rough period, I must say. Can you remember telling your mom, I can't
            wait to I get big and move out. We can laugh at that now. But going
            through what I went through lead me to a 20 year career as a
            Registered Respiratoy therapist, helping others. As I continue on
            that journey I'm
            <em><strong>forking</strong></em> (do you <strong>git</strong> it)
            of that path as a FullStack Developer student currently at Codex
            Academy.

            I love watching sports and spending time with my family. I try to
            provide them with much love as I can and explain to them life
            situations. They are going to go through the same process as me, and
            I'll be there for them no matter what as my mom was there for me. On
            a more positive note, how bout them Steelers and my top three food
            dishes.
