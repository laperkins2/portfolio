          Growing up as a kid, without a care in the world. I could not have
          imagine how my life up to this point would have played out. You have
          dreams of what you want to accomplish and become. From six to ten I
          can remember I wanted to be an architect, electronic engineer and
          superman. Now from 11 to 16, i still had those dreams but this was the
          time where other influnces started playing tug of war with me. I
          started trying to figure out who I was. Sixteen to twenty-one was a
          rough period, I must say. Can you remember telling your mom, I can't
          wait to I get big and move out. We can laugh at that now. But going
          through what I went through lead me to a 20 year career as a
          Registered Respiratoy therapist, helping others. As I continue on that
          journey I'm
          <em><strong>forking</strong></em> (do you <strong>git</strong> it) off
          that path as a FullStack Developer student currently at Codex Academy.
