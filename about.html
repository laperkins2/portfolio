              Some say that or want to think that you are doomed when decisions
              that you make in your life leads you down the wrong path. Or that
              the hand that you were dealt at birth had no chance of winning at
              all. What if I tell you that the decisions that you made doesn't
              have to define your life. What if I told you that the hand you was
              dealt, was not a lost! Someone told me that I been through both
              and made it when a lot of people would've gave up. If I would have
              kept that same mindset, I would have agreed. No!! I'm not a victim
              of my environment. I changed my mindset, I wasn't dealt a bad
              hand, I just had to know how to play it. The decision I made, I
              had to own it. So the second chance that I got, that is who I am.
              Not the person that made those mistakes.
