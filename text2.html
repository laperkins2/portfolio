                  Some say that or want to think that you are doomed when
                  decisions that you make in your life leads you down the wrong
                  path. Or that the hand that you were dealt at birth had no
                  chance of winning at all. What if I tell you that the
                  decisions that you made doesn't have to define your life. What
                  if I told you that the hand you was dealt, was not a lost!
                  Someone told me that I been through both and made it when a
                  lot of people wouldv've gave up. If I would have kept that
                  same mindset, I would have agreed. No!! I'm not a victim of my
                  environment. I changed my mindset, I wasn't dealt a bad hand,
                  I just had to know how to play it. The decision I made, I had
                  to own it. So the second chance that I got, that is my story.
